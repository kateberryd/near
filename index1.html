   <div class="pl-20">
    <p >NEAR is a decentralized development platform utilizing
        developer-friendly, sharded, proof-of-stake
        public blockchain that aspires to make it very easy for developers to build decentralized
        applications (dapps). Dapps provide users with easy-to-use applications that guarantee the security
        of high values assets like money and identity.
        <br>
        NEAR is building the infrastructure for the decentralized web, including the NEAR Protocol Smart
        Contract platform plus a variety of other supporting tools. NEAR is a scalable blockchain designed
        to provide the performance and user experience required to bridge the gaps in the mainstream
        adoption of decentralized applications. <br> <br> NEAR, unlike other next-generation
        blockchain-based platforms, is built from the ground up, to be the easiest in the world for both
        developers and their end-users, at the same time, providing the scalability and security needed to
        serve those users. Specifically, NEAR's architecture makes it easier to: <br> <br>

            <p> <strong>How it work</strong><br>
                NEAR provides a community-operated cloud-based infrastructure for deploying and running dapps by
                combining the features of a decentralized database with a serverless computing platform. The NEAR
                token, which allows this platform to run, also enables applications built on it to interact with
                each other. <br>

        <p> Together, these features allow developers to create censorship-resistant smart contracts for applications
            that deal with high-end data like money, identity, assets, and open-state components that need to interact
            seamlessly with each other. The infrastructure which makes up this cloud is created
            from a potentially infinite number of "nodes" run by individuals and organizations who offer portions of
            their CPU and hard drive space — whether on a laptop or, more likely, professionally deployed servers.

            As mentioned, the NEAR community-run cloud is decentralized so that updates must be accepted by a sufficient
            majority of the network participants or nodes. To ensure that the operators of nodes run the code well, they
            participate in a staking process called "Proof of Stake". In this process, they willingly put a portion of
            value at 'stake' as a deposit which they forfeit if it is established that they have operated
            inappropriately.
            In essence, NEAR is providing a decentralized version of the cloud-hosted services provided by Amazon or

                The NEAR platform has been designed to be used in a permissionless way. However, a set of
                community-built tools and reference guides have been created to help developers.
                The NEAR team provides a set of straightforward command-line tools to enable developers to easily
                create, test and deploy applications from their local environments.

        <p>NEAR also uses existing technology, Gitpod, to create zero time onboarding experience for developers. Gitpod
            provides an online "Integrated Development Environment" (IDE), which NEAR customized to allow developers to
            easily write, test and deploy smart contracts from a web browser.
            Very importantly, NEAR has the solutions for scaling by eliminating the barriers to Web 3 adoption. With
            high speeds, low fees, and progressive UX, NEAR's climate-neutral blockchain is ready for explosive growth.
            Also, NEAR is set for a multi-chain future, as it runs in concert with Ethereum, Polkadot, Cosmos, and more,
            allowing for the free flow of assets and communication between networks for the betterment of all.

        <p>NEAR focuses on providing solutions to the two core problems of today's blockchains — usability and
            scalability. Usability for end-users is achieved by providing a security model for wallet interactions and
            giving developers more opportunities to create experiences that closely resemble applications and
            experiences the masses are familiar with.

            Usability for developers is attained by setting up the protocol to allow browser-based debugging, familiar
            programming languages (like AssemblyScript and Rust), and contract usage rebates or rewards. Scalability is
            made possible by sharding the chain into a potentially unlimited number of subchains, each operating in
            parallel.
